# -RDKit-Baseline-Workflow
A minimal demonstration of molecular descriptor computation and property prediction using RDKit and scikit-learn. 
- Generates descriptors (MolWt, TPSA, LogP, H-bond donors/acceptors)
- Predicts LogP using Random Forest regression (R² ≈ 0.16 baseline)
- Includes pairplot visualization of descriptor correlations

This notebook was created to familiarize myself with molecular data workflows, bridging my background in generative modeling and materials imaging with molecular AI and property prediction.
